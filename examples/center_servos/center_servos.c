	test_servos.c
	
	demonstrates use of pru to control servos or ESCs with pulse widths
	note that this library purposefully sends only a single pulse for
	each call to send_servo_pulse_us(). This allows the user to send
	pulses immediately after calculating a control input and at any
	arbitrary frequency to suit specific hardware. For example a user can
	send a 50hz signal to control a servo on one channel and a 200hz signal
	on another channel for controlling high-performance brushless ESCs
