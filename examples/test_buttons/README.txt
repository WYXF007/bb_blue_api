Project Description:
This is a good starting program to learn how to use buttons and LEDs, it is also a good option for an auto-run program to add to Auto_Run_Script.sh. This program makes the green and red LED's flash. Pressing the mode button cycles the frequency of the flashing lights. Pressing the pause button toggles whether or not the LEDs flash at all. Hold the pause button down to exit the program.
