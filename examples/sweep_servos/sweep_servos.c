	sweep_servos.c
	
	Demonstrates use of pru to control servos or ESCs with pulse widths
	it simply sweeps the servos position back and forth around the center.
	
	This program takes in one optional argument which is the channel to
	drive between 1 and 8. If no argument is given it drives all 8 channels.
