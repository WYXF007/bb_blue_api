	test_servos.c
	
	demonstrates use of pru to control servos or ESCs with pulse widths.
	This program takes in 1 or 2 arguments. 
	
	The first argument is the pulse width in either microseconds or a normalized
	value from 0 to 1. the normalized value will scale to microseconds between 
	900 and 2100 microseconds which is common for servos.
	
	The seconds argument is optional and is the channel between 1 and 8.
	If the second argument isn't given then all servos are driven.
