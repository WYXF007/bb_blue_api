James Strawson - 2014

Project Description:
The ADNS_9800 is a high resolution optical mouse sensor. Since it operates over SPI, you can communicate with either of the SPI sockets on the Robotics Cape. This program demonstrates use of SPI with the linux ioctl library and the select_slave function from the robotics cape library.
