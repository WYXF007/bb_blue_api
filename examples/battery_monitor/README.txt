Battery Monitor for Robotics Cape
James Strawson - 2014

Project Description:
Battery monitor service for Robotics Cape. This program starts automatically on 
boot with Auto_Run_Script.sh in order to illuminate the set of 4 battery 
indicator LEDS on the Robotics Cape to indicate battery charge level of a 2S, 
3S, or 4S Lithium Ion or Polymer Battery. This program also shuts down 
BeagleBone cleanly and therefore the last running robotics project cleanly when 
the 2S battery voltage becomes close to the under-voltage protection cut-off.
