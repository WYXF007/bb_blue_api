* INITIALIZATION AND CLEANUP
*
* @ int initialize_cape() 
*
* The user MUST call initialize_cape at beginning of your program. 
* In addition to setting up hardware, it also places a process id file
* in the file system at "/run/robotics_cape.pid" to indicate your program is
* using the robotics cape library and hardware. If initialize_cape() is called
* with an existing pid file in /run/ then it will try to shut down the existing 
* program before continuing with your own to avoid conflicts.
* 
* @ int cleanup_cape() 
*
* This removes the pid file and closes file pointers cleanly. 
* 
*
* All example programs use these functions. See the bare_minimum example 
* for a skeleton outline.

*
* The user is encouraged to manage the initialization,running, and closing of 
* their threads with the globally accessible program flow state. This state
* can be set and accessed with get_state() and set_state() declared here.
* Calling initialize_cape() will set the state to UNINITIALIZED. When the
* user's own initialization sequence is complete they should set the flow
* state to RUNNING to indicate to other threads that the program should now
* behave in normal ongoing operational mode. Threads and loops should also
* independently check for an EXITING state to know when to close and exit
* cleanly when prompted by another thread.
*
* All example programs use these functions. See the bare_minimum example

* LEDs
*
* Since the 4 blue USR LEDs on the Beaglebone are normally used by the OS,
* the Robotics Cape provides two LEDs for sole use by the user. One is red
* and one is green. The included examples use the red LED to indicate a paused
* or stopped state, and the green LED to indicate a running state. However
* they are not tied to any other robotics cape library functions and can be 
* used for whatever the user desires.

* @ typedef enum led_t
*

*
* @ int set_led(led_t led, int state)

* BUTTONS
*
* The Robotics Cape includes two buttons labeled PAUSE and MODE. Like the LEDs,
* they are not used by any background library functions and the user can assign
* them to any function they wish. However, the user is encouraged to use the
* pause button to toggle the program flow state between PAUSED and RUNNING

*
* initialize_cape() sets up interrupt handlers that run in the background to
* handle changes in button state in a way that uses minimal resources. The 
* user can assign which function should be called when either button is pressed
* or released. Functions can also be assigned under both conditions.
* for example, a timer could be started when a button is pressed and stopped
* when the button is released. Pass
*
* For simple tasks like pausing the robot, the user is encouraged to assign
* their function to be called when the button is released as this provides 
* a more natural user experience aligning with consumer product functionality.
*
* 
* The user can also just do a basic call to get_pause_button_state() or
* get_mode_buttom_state() which returns the enumerated type RELEASED or 
* PRESSED.

* DC MOTOR CONTROL
*
* The robotics cape can drive 4 DC motors bidirectionally from a 2-cell lithium

* 2 - 3.3V
* 3 - Signal A
* 4 - Signal B
*
* The first 3 channels are counted by the Sitara's eQEP hardware encoder
* counters. The 4th channel is counted by the PRU. As a result, no CPU cycles
* are wasted counting encoders and the user only needs to read the channel
* at any point in their code to get the current position. All channels are 
* reset to 0 when initialize_cape() is called. However, the user can reset
* the counter to zero or any other signed 32 bit value with set_encoder_pos().

* SERVO AND ESC 
*
* The Robotics Cape has 8 3-pin headers for connecting hobby servos and ESCs.
* The connectors are not polarized so pay close attention to the symbols
* printed in white silkscreen on the cape before plugging anything in.
* The standard pinnout for these 3 pin connectors is as follows.
*
* 1 - Ground
* 2 - 6V Power
* 3 - Pulse width signal
*
* @ int enable_servo_power_rail()
* @ int disable_servo_power_rail()
*
* The user must call enable_servo_power_rail() to enable the 6V voltage 
* regulator and send power to servos. This can be ignored if using ESCs or 
* servos that are driven by an external power source.
* disable_servo_power_rail() can be called to turn off power to the servos for
* example when the robot is in a paused state to save power or prevent noisy
* servos from buzzing.
*
* @ int send_servo_pulse_normalized(int ch, float input)
* @ int send_servo_pulse_normalized_all(float input)
*
* The normal operating range of hobby servos is usually +- 60 degrees of 
* rotation from the neutral position but they often work up to +- 90 degrees.
* send_servo_pulse_normalized(int ch, float input) will send a single pulse to
* the selected channel. the normalized input should be between -1.5 and 1.5
* corresponding to the following pulse width range and angle.
*
* input     width   angle  
* -1.5		600us	90 deg anticlockwise
* -1.0		900us	60 deg anticlockwise
*  0.0		1500us	0 deg neutral
*  1.0		2100us	60 deg clockwise
*  1.5		2400us	90 deg clockwise
*
* Note that all servos are different and do not necessarily allow the full
* range of motion past +-1.0. DO NOT STALL SERVOS.
*
* @ int send_esc_pulse_normalized(int ch, float input)
* @ int send_esc_pulse_normalized_all(float input)
*
* Brushless motor controllers (ESCs) for planes and multirotors are
* unidirectional and lend themselves better to a normalized range from 0 to 1.
* send_esc_pulse_normalized(int ch, float input) also sends a single pulse
* but the range is scaled as follows:
*
* input     width   power  
* 0.0		900us	0%   off
* 0.5		1500us	50%  half-throttle
* 1.0		2100us	100% full-throttle
*
* This assumes the ESCs have been calibrated for the 900-2100us range. Use the
* calibrate_escs example program to be sure.
*
* @ int send_servo_pulse_us(int ch, int us)
* @ int send_servo_pulse_us_all(int us)
*
* The user may also elect to manually specify the exact pulse width in
* in microseconds with send_servo_pulse_us(int ch, int us). When using any of
* these functions, be aware that they only send a single pulse to the servo
* or ESC. Servos and ESCs typically require an update frequency of at least 
* 10hz to prevent timing out. The timing accuracy of this loop is not critical
* and the user can choose to update at whatever frequency they wish.

* 9-AXIS IMU
*
* The Robotics Cape features an Invensense MPU9250 9-axis IMU. This API allows
* the user to configure this IMU in two modes: RANDOM and DMP
*
* RANDOM: The accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and thermometer can be
* read directly at any time. To use this mode, call initialize_imu() with your
* imu_config and imu_data structs as arguments as defined below. You can then
* call read_accel_data, read_gyro_data, read_mag_data, or read_imu_temp
* at any time to get the latest sensor values.
*
* DMP: Stands for Digital Motion Processor which is a feature of the MPU9250.
* in this mode, the DMP will sample the sensors internally and fill a FIFO
* buffer with the data at a fixed rate. Furthermore, the DMP will also calculate
* a filtered orientation quaternion which is placed in the same buffer. When
* new data is ready in the buffer, the IMU sends an interrupt to the BeagleBone
* triggering the buffer read followed by the execution of a function of your
* choosing set with the set_imu_interrupt_func() function.
*
* @ enum accel_fsr_t gyro_fsr_t
* 
* The user may choose from 4 full scale ranges of the accelerometer and
* gyroscope. They have units of gravity (G) and degrees per second (DPS)
* The defaults values are A_FSR_4G and G_FSR_1000DPS respectively.
*
* enum accel_dlpf_t gyro_dlpf_t 
*
* The user may choose from 7 digital low pass filter constants for the 
* accelerometer and gyroscope. The filter runs at 1kz and helps to reduce sensor
* noise when sampling more slowly. The default values are ACCEL_DLPF_184
* GYRO_DLPF_250. Lower cut-off frequencies incur phase-loss in measurements.
*
* @ struct imu_config_t
*
* Configuration struct passed to initialize_imu and initialize_imu_dmp. It is 
* best to get the default config with get_default_imu_config() function and
* modify from there.
*
* @ struct imu_data_t 
*
* This is the container for holding the sensor data from the IMU.
* The user is intended to make their own instance of this struct and pass
* its pointer to imu read functions.
*
* @ imu_config_t get_default_imu_config()
* 
* Returns an imu_config_t struct with default settings. Use this as a starting
* point and modify as you wish.
*
* @ int initialize_imu(imu_data_t *data, imu_config_t conf)
*
* Sets up the IMU in random-read mode. First create an instance of the imu_data
* struct to point to as initialize_imu will put useful data in it.
* initialize_imu only reads from the config struct. After this, you may read
* sensor data.

* @ int read_gyro_data(imu_data_t *data)
* @ int read_mag_data(imu_data_t *data)

*
* These are the functions for random sensor sampling at any time. Note that
* if you wish to read the magnetometer then it must be enabled in the
* configuration struct. Since the magnetometer requires additional setup and
* is slower to read, it is disabled by default.
